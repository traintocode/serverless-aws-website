Verse 1:
I'm walking down the street
And I see it in the distance
A zebra crossing, a sign of safety
I know it's my chance to take a break

Chorus:
Zebra crossing, zebra crossing
It's a sign of hope, it's a sign of trust
It's a way to get to the other side
And make it through the rush

Verse 2:
The cars slow down, and I can see
The white stripes shining in the sun
I step onto the road, with confidence
And make it safely to the other side

Chorus:
Zebra crossing, zebra crossing
It's a sign of hope, it's a sign of trust
It's a way to get to the other side
And make it through the rush

Bridge:
It's not just a painted line on the ground
It's a symbol of our humanity
A reminder to look out for each other
And to always be aware

Chorus:
Zebra crossing, zebra crossing
It's a sign of hope, it's a sign of trust
It's a way to get to the other side
And make it through the rush

Outro:
So when you're out on the street
And you see a zebra crossing
Remember to stop and take a look
And make it safely to the other side.
