Verse 1:
Code on my screen, never stops my dream
Gotta get that script to run, nothing's gonna be mean
Debugging all night, but everything's gonna be alright
I'll make that app come to life, it's gonna be bright

Chorus:
I'm a coder, I'm a hacker
I'm a programmer, I'm a master
Making things with code, it's what I do
Watch my code come to life, it's like magic, who knew

Verse 2:
Gotta get that algorithm right, gonna make it tight
Gonna make that website fly, gonna make it light
Gotta get that data to flow, gonna make it go
I'll make that game come to life, gonna make it grow

Chorus:
I'm a coder, I'm a hacker
I'm a programmer, I'm a master
Making things with code, it's what I do
Watch my code come to life, it's like magic, who knew

Bridge:
I'll never stop, I'll never tire
I'll keep coding higher and higher
I'll make the impossible, possible
With code, I'll make it unstoppable

Outro:
Code on my screen, never stops my dream
Gotta get that script to run, nothing's gonna be mean
Debugging all night, but everything's gonna be alright
I'll make that app come to life, it's gonna be bright
