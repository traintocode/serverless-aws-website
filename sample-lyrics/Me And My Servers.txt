Verse 1:
I used to worry 'bout my servers
Scaling up and down, it was a real hassle
But now I've found a new way
To keep my app running all day

Chorus:
Serverless, serverless
No more worries, no more stress
I can focus on my code
And let the cloud do the load

Verse 2:
No more managing instances
No more worrying about persistence
Just write your code and deploy
And let the cloud take care of the rest

Chorus:
Serverless, serverless
No more worries, no more stress
I can focus on my code
And let the cloud do the load

Bridge:
Scaling's a breeze, and costs are low
Serverless is the way to go
So join me in this revolution
And make your life a little bit easier

Chorus:
Serverless, serverless
No more worries, no more stress
I can focus on my code
And let the cloud do the load

Outro:
Serverless, serverless
It's the future, it's progress
Let's make the most of it
And enjoy the benefits.
