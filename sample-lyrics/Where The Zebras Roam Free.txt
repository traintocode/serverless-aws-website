Verse 1:
Out on the savannah, where the grass is tall
There's a herd of zebras, standing tall
With their stripes so bold and black and white
They're a sight to see, in the morning light

Chorus:
Zebras, zebras
Wild and free
They roam the plains
With grace and dignity

Verse 2:
They're the masters of survival
In the African heat
With their strong legs and sharp minds
They can't be beat

Chorus:
Zebras, zebras
Wild and free
They roam the plains
With grace and dignity

Bridge:
They may look similar, but each one is unique
With their own personalities, they're not meek
They're strong and fierce, and fiercely loyal
To their herd and family, they're so royal

Chorus:
Zebras, zebras
Wild and free
They roam the plains
With grace and dignity

Outro:
So let's raise a glass to the zebras of the wild
May their stripes forever be filed
In the memory of all who see
The majestic beauty of the zebra.
